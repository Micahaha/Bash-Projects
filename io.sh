# you use the echo command

echo Hello, who am i talking to? 
# Read user input into a variable
read varname
# Display a message to the user that includes the
# value stored in the variable

# You can alter the behavior of read with a variety of 
# command line options.
# Two commonly used options are -p which allows you
# to specify a prompt and -s which makes the input 
# silent.
# This can make it easy to ask for a user name and 
# password combination.
